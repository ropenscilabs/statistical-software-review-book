<span class="header-section-number">A.1</span> Notes on Scope and the Python Statistical Ecosystem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#python"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Two factors may be usefully noted in this regard:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The potential number of python packages for statistical analyses is likely
to be relatively more restricted than relative numbers of <strong>R</strong> packages.
Taking as indicative presentations at the previous three Joint Statistical
Meetings (JSMs; 2018-2020), no python packages were referred to in any
abstract, while 32 <strong>R</strong> packages were presented, along with two
meta-platforms for <strong>R</strong> packages. Presentations at the Symposium of Data
Science and Statistics (SDSS) for 2018-19 similarly including numerous
presentations of <strong>R</strong> packages, along with presentation of
<a href="https://altair-viz.github.io">three</a>
<a href="https://github.com/ajboyd2/salmon">python</a>
<a href="https://github.com/dlsun/symbulate">packages</a>. It may accordingly be
expected that potential expansion to include python packages will demand
relatively very little time or effort compared with that devoted to <strong>R</strong>
packages as the primary software scope.</li>
<li>In spite of the above, the community of python users is enormously greater,
reflected in the currently 311,915 packages compared with
17,751 packages on CRAN, or over 17 times as
many python packages. Similarly, 41.7% of all respondents to the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">2019
stackoverflow developer
survey</a> nominated python as
their most popular language, compared with only 5.8% who nominated <strong>R</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The relative importance of python is powerfully reflected in temporal trends
from the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">stackoverflow developer
survey</a> from the previous three
years, with results shown in the following graphic.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="statistical-software-review-book_files/figure-html/py_v_r-1.png" width="100%"></div>
<p>Python is not only more used and more loved than <strong>R</strong>, but both statistics for
python have consistently grown at a faster rate over the past three years as
have equivalent statistics for <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p>Both languages nevertheless have relative well-defined standards for software
packaging, python via the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects">Python Package Index
(pypi)</a>, and <strong>R</strong>
via <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a>. In contrast to CRAN, which runs its own
checks on all packages on a daily basis, there are no automatic checks for
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects">pypi</a> packages, and
almost any form of package that minimally conforms to the standards may be
submitted. This much lower effective barrier to entry likely partially
contributes to the far greater numbers of
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects">pypi</a>
(311,915) than
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org">CRAN</a> (17,751) packages.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">A.2</span> Empirical Derivation of Categories<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#appendix-categories"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>We attempted to derive a realistic categorisation through using empirical data
from several sources of potential software submissions, including all
apparently “statistical” R packages published in the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org">Journal of Open Source
Software (JOSS</a>), packages published in the <a href="https://www.jstatsoft.org/index">Journal of
Statistical Software</a>, software presented at
the 2018 and 2019 Joint Statistical Meetings (JSM), and Symposia on Data
Science and Statistics (SDSS), well as CRAN task views. We have also compiled
a list of the descriptions of <a href="https://github.com/mpadge/statistical-software/blob/master/abstracts/ropensci-abstracts.md">all packages rejected by
rOpenSci</a>
as being out of current scope because of current inability to consider
statistical packages, along with a selection of <a href="https://github.com/mpadge/statistical-software/blob/master/abstracts/joss-abstracts.md">recent statistical
R packages</a>
accepted by JOSS. (The full list of all R package published by JOSS can be
viewed at <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers//in/R" class="uri">https://joss.theoj.org/papers//in/R</a>).</p>
<p>We allocated one or more key words (or phrases) to each abstract, and use the
frequencies and inter-connections between these to inform the following
categorisation are represented in the <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software/abstracts/network-terms/index.html">interactive
graphic</a>
(also included in the <a href="appendices.html#appendix-keywords">Appendix</a>), itself derived from
analyses of abstracts from all statistical software submitted to both rOpenSci
and JOSS. (Several additional analyses and graphical representations of these
raw data are included an <a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software">auxiliary github
repository</a>.) The primary

reference to inter-relationships between categories, and in particular to
potential ambiguity within and between any categorisation. An example of such
ambiguity, and of potential difficulties associated with categorisation, is the
category of “network” software which appropriate describes the
<a href="https://github.com/jakobbossek/grapherator"><code>grapherator</code></a> package (with
accompanying <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00528">JOSS paper</a>)
which is effectively a distribution generator for data represented in
a particular format that happens to represent a graph; and three JSM
presentations, one on <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=327171">network-based clustering of high-dimensional
data</a>,
one on <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=328764">community structure in dynamic
networks</a>
and one on <a href="https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2018/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=328764">Gaussian graphical
models</a>.
Standards derived for network software must accommodate such diversity of
applications, and must accommodate software for which the “network” category
may pertain only to some relatively minor aspect, while the primary algorithms
or routines may not be related to network software in any direct way.</p>

</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org">JOSS</a>
conducts its own peer review process, and publishes textual descriptions of
accepted software. Each piece of software then has its own web page on the
journal’s site, on which the text is presented as a compiled <code>.pdf</code>-format
document, along with links to the open review, as well as to the software
repository. The published document must be included within the software
repository in a file named <code>paper.md</code>, which enables automatic extraction and
analysis of these text descriptions of software. Rather than attempt
a comprehensive, and unavoidably subjective, categorization of software, these
textual descriptions were used to identify key words or phrases (hereafter,
“keywords”) which encapsulated the purpose, function, or other general
descriptive elements of each piece of software. Each paper generally yielded
multiple keywords. Extracting these from all papers judged to be potentially in
scope allowed for the construction of a network of topics, in which the nodes
were the key words and phrases, and the connections between any pair of nodes
reflected the number of times those two keywords co-occurred across all papers.</p>
<p>We extracted all papers accepted and published by JOSS (217 at the time of
writing in early 2020), and manually determined which of these were broadly
statistical, reducing the total to 92. We then read through the contents of
each of these, and recorded as many keywords as possible for each paper. The
resultant network is shown in the following interactive graphic, in which nodes
are scaled by numbers of occurrences, and edges by numbers of co-occurrences.

central concepts including, in our case, several that we may not otherwise have
conceived of as having been potentially in scope. We then used this network to
define our set of key “in scope” concepts. This figure also reveals that many
of these keywords are somewhat “lower level” than the kinds of concepts we
might otherwise have used to define scoping categories. For example, keywords
such as “likelihood” or “probability” are not likely to be useful in defining
actual categories of statistical software, yet they turned out to lie at the
centres of relatively well-defined groups of related keywords.</p>
<p>We also examined the forms of both input and output data for each of the 92
pieces of software described in these JOSS papers, and constructed <a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software/abstracts/network-io/index.html">an
additional

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">A.4</span> Other Software Standards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#appendix-other-software-standards"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Among the noteworthy instances of software standards, the following are
particularly relevant:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The <a href="https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en">Core Infrastructure Initiative’s Best Practices
Badge</a>, which is granted to
software meeting an extensive list of
<a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md">criteria</a>.
This list of criteria provides a singularly useful reference for software
standards.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/">Software Sustainability Institute</a>’s
<a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/resources/guides-everything/software-evaluation-guide"><em>Software Evaluation
Guide</em></a>,
in particular their guide to <a href="http://software.ac.uk/sites/default/files/SSI-SoftwareEvaluationCriteria.pdf"><em>Criteria-based software
evaluation</em></a>,
which considers two primary categories of <em>Usability</em> and <em>Sustainability
and Maintainability</em>, each of which is divided into numerous sub-categories.
The guide identifies numerous concrete criteria for each sub-category,
explicitly detailed below in order to provide an example of the kind of
standards that might be adapted and developed for application to the present
project.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://transparentstats.github.io/guidelines/"><em>Transparent Statistics
Guidelines</em></a>, by the “HCI
(Human Computer Interaction) Working Group”. While currently only in its
beginning phases, that document aims to provide concrete guidance on
“transparent statistical communication.” If its development continues, it is
likely to provide useful guidelines on best practices for how statistical
software produces and reports results.</li>
<li>The more technical considerations of the <a href="https://www.omg.org/index.htm">Object Management
Group</a>’s <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/ASCMM/"><em>Automated Source Code CISQ
Maintainability Measure</em></a> (where CISQ
refers to the <a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/"><em>Consortium for IT Software
Quality</em></a>). This guide describes a number of
measures which can be automatically extracted and used to quantify the
maintainability of source code. None of these measures are not already
considered in one or both of the preceding two documents, but the
identification of measures particularly amenable to automated assessment
provides a particularly useful reference.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also rOpenSci’s guide on <a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/">package development, maintenance, and peer
review</a>, which provides standards of this type
for R packages, primarily within its first chapter. Another notable example is
the <a href="https://principles.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse design guide</a>, and the
section on <a href="https://tidymodels.github.io/model-implementation-principles/">Conventions for R Modeling
Packages</a> which
provides guidance for model-fitting APIs.</p>
<p>Specific standards for neural network algorithms have also been developed as
part of a <a href="http://www.inmodelia.com/gsoc2019.html">google 2019 Summer Of Code
project</a>, resulting in a dedicated
R package, <a href="https://akshajverma.com/NNbenchmarkWeb/index.html"><code>NNbenchmark</code></a>,
and accompanying results—their so-called
<a href="https://akshajverma.com/NNbenchmarkWeb/notebooks.html">“notebooks”</a>—of
applying their benchmarks to a suite of neural network packages.</p>
