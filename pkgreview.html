<p>The current chapter should be considered an extension of the corresponding
<a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewerguide.html">“Guide for Reviewers”</a> in
rOpenSci’s “Dev Guide”. The principles for reviewing packages described there
also apply to statistical packages, with this chapter describing additional
processes and practices for review of packages submitted to the statistical
software peer review system. Reviews of statistical software should
first assess compliance against <a href="standards.html#standards">our
standards</a>,
and then proceed to a more general review, as described in the following two
sub-sections. The template to be used for reviews of statistical software is
included in the final sub-section of this chapter. Prior to describing the
review process, the following sub-section describes several tools which can be
used to aid review.</p>
<div id="tools-for-reviewing-statistical-software" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Tools for Reviewing Statistical Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#tools-for-reviewing-statistical-software"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Upon initial submission, the <code>ropensci-review-bot</code> generates an automated
report summarising aspects of package structure and functionality intended to
inform the review process, an example of which can be seen
<a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/statistical-software-review-book/blob/main/scripts/pkgcheck-ex.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>The elements of these reports are described in the
<a href="pkgsubmission.html#pkgsub-handling-editor"><em>Guide for Editors</em></a>. While the aspects reported on
there are primarily intended to help editors initially identify potential
issues best addressed prior to review, they nevertheless include a number of
insights into package structure which may usefully inform the review process.</p>
<p>Components of these reports intended to aid reviews include a complete report
of standards compliance, generated with the
<a href="https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr"><code>srr</code></a> package, and an
interactive diagram of inter-relationships between package functions (and other
objects), generated with the
<a href="https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats"><code>pkgstats</code></a> package. These
can be recreated locally by first installing these two packages by running
either,</p>

with the sample report linking to a version of that report which may be viewed
<a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/roreviewapi/static/demo_srr77dfe392.html">here</a>,

provides immediate visual insight into the relationships between all objects
constructed within a package in all languages used, both <strong>R</strong> itself and any
languages used in <code>src/</code> code such as C or C++. The following section describes
the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr"><code>srr</code></a> report in more
detail, and its intended use in assessing compliance with our standards.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Assessment Against Standards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessment-against-standards"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The entire system for peer review of statistical software is based on sets of
general and category-specific standards given in <a href="standards.html#standards">Chapter 6 of this
book</a>. The process of assessing software against standards is
facilitated by the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr"><code>srr</code> (<strong>s</strong>oftware <strong>r</strong>eview <strong>r</strong>oclets)
package</a> which both authors and
reviewers need to install as shown above.</p>
<p>This package is primarily intended to aid authors in documenting both how and
where their software complies with each of the relevant general and
category-specific standards. The function of the package used to aid reviewers
is
<a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/reference/srr_report.html"><code>srr_report()</code></a>,
the output of which is linked from the initial package report described above,
and can also be generated locally by simply running that function within
a local clone of the package being reviewed. The report contains hyperlinks to
all places in the code at which each standard is addressed.</p>
<p>Using this report, reviewers must assess their agreement with every statement
either of compliance with, or non-applicability of, standards as reflected in
<a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/articles/srr-stats.html#3-roxygen2-tags">roclet
tags</a>
of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<code>@srrstats</code> for standards with which software complies;</li>
<li>
<code>@srrstatsNA</code> for standards which authors have deemed not to be
applicable to their software.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
<a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/reference/srr_report.html"><code>srr_report()</code></a>
is divided into two main sections containing links to locations in the code
where these two types of tags are documented. No action need be taken on
standards with which reviewers agree, whether because software complies and has
a tag of <code>@srrstats</code>, or because a standard is not applicable and has a tag of
<code>@srrstatsNA</code>. Reviewers are only asked to note any standards with which they
disagree, primarily either because of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Disagreement in standards compliance, where authors have used a tag of
<code>@srrstats</code> but a reviewer judges either the explanation or associated code
to be insufficient for compliance; or</li>
<li>Disagreement about non-applicability of a standard, where authors have
used a tag of <code>@srrstatsNA</code>, but a reviewer believes that standard ought to
apply to the software.</li>
</ol>
<p>The
<a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/reference/srr_report.html"><code>srr_report()</code></a>
function returns the same content in markdown format, and may be used by
reviewers as an initial checklist against which to assess compliance. All
standards with which reviewers agree with authors statements of compliance may
simply be removed, hopefully reducing initially extensive checklists down to
a manageable few items with which reviews might disagree.</p>
<p>The following sub-section describes additional procedures required when
assessing standards compliance of packages aiming for either
<a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-silver">silver</a> or <a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-gold">gold</a> badges. The general <code>srr</code>
procedure is described in the <a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/articles/srr-stats.html">main package
vignette</a>,
which reviewers are also encouraged to read to familiarise themselves with how
the <a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr"><code>srr</code> package</a> is used to
document compliance with standards. The <a href="https://ropensci-review-tools.github.io/srr/articles/srr-stats.html">main <code>srr</code>
vignette</a>
includes code which can be stepped through to generate an example report.</p>
<div id="review-for-silver-and-gold-badges" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Review for Silver and Gold Badges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#review-for-silver-and-gold-badges"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>This system for peer-review of statistical software features badges in three
categories of <strong>bronze</strong>, <strong>silver</strong>, and <strong>gold</strong>. As described in the
corresponding <a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-badges"><em>Guide for Authors</em></a>, a <strong>silver</strong> badge is
granted to software which complies with more than a minimal set of applicable
standards, and which extends beyond bronze in least one <a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-silver">notable
aspect</a> while a <strong>gold</strong> badge is granted to software which
complies with <em>all</em> standards which reviewers have deemed potentially
applicable, and which extends beyond bronze in several notable aspects. These
<a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-gold">notable aspects</a> by which software may fulfil the requirements
of <strong>silver</strong> or <strong>gold</strong> badges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compliance with a sufficient number of additional standards beyond the
minimal number necessary for bronze compliance;</li>
<li>Demonstrated excellence in compliance with at least two standards from two
distinct sub-sections;</li>
<li>Having a demonstrated generality of usage beyond a single use case; or</li>
<li>Demonstrated excellence in internal aspects of package design and structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors will have identified in their initial submission which of these
aspects they intend to fulfil. For packages which claim to comply with more
than a minimal number of necessary standards, reviewers must additionally
consider both which of the standards with which software complies might be
considered minimally necessary, as well as whether any standards which authors
have identified as not applicable (through <code>@ssrstatsNA</code> tags) could indeed be
deemed applied. Not all standards may be able to be applied to a given piece of
software. For example, software designed to accept sparse matrix inputs from
the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html"><code>Matrix</code>
package</a> will be
unable to conform with many of the standards for general rectangular input
forms.</p>
<p>These three categories of necessary, currently, and potentially applicable
standards can then be used by reviewers to roughly assess the quantitative
degree by which compliance exceeds a minimally required level. As stated in the
<a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-silver"><em>Guide for Authors</em></a>, the first of these four items may be
considered to be fulfilled for software which meets at least one quarter of all
potentially applicable standards beyond those minimally required. A useful
example of minimally required standards may often be identified as those which
would be required for the software to meet one specific use case. Any aspects
of the software which generalise its usage beyond that single use case may be
considered in the second category of potentially yet not necessarily
applicable. Judgement of such categorical distinction, and of precise amounts,
is left to the discretion of reviewers.</p>
<p>Packages aiming for gold badges at the end of review will need to comply with
all potentially applicable standards, and will also need to fulfil at least
three of the four aspects listed above, and described in more detail in the
<a href="pkgdev.html#pkgdev-silver"><em>Guide for Authors</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="disagreement-with-authors-intentions" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Disagreement with Authors’ Intentions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#disagreement-with-authors-intentions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Authors must state on submission the grade of badge they are aiming for.
Reviewers may subsequently deem a package to be compliant with a different
grade of badge. The <a href="pkgreview.html#pkgrev-template">review template</a> includes the following
two items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<input type="checkbox" disabled>
This package complies with a sufficient number of standards for
a (bronze/silver/gold) badge</li>
<li>
<input type="checkbox" disabled>
This grade of badge is the same as what the authors wanted to achieve</li>
</ul>
<p>The first item is intended to specify the grade of badge (bronze, silver, gold)
which reflects the reviewer’s judgement, and need not necessarily reflect the
authors intentions. The second item may be checked when a reviewer agrees with
the authors that a package is indeed sufficient to achieve their desired badge.
Where reviewers do not agree with authors’ beliefs on package package
compliance, the second item should be left unchecked in the submitted review.
The editor will then ask authors for their response, and will inform whether
additional rounds of development and review are necessary to obtain the grade
of badge desired by the authors.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> General Package Review<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-package-review"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>From a reviewer’s perspective, one of the primary aim of our standards-based
system is to provide a highly structured system for addressing the technical
aspects of review, leaving the general review process comparably free of
technical details, and therefore more able to consider broader aspects of
package design, functionality, and usage.</p>
<p>Following assessment of compliance with standards, reviewers should accordingly
proceed with a general descriptive review by following the processes
established in rOpenSci’s general software review system, for which the best
source of information is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues">reviews
themselves</a>, along with the
<a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/reviewerguide.html"><em>Guide for Reviewers</em></a>.
In formulating a general review of statistical software, we ask reviewers to
explicitly consider the following aspects, some of which loosely correspond to
sub-sections of the <a href="standards.html#general-standards"><em>General Standards for Statistical
Software</em></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Documentation</strong>: Is the documentation sufficient to enable general use of
the package beyond one specific use case? Do the various components of
documentation support and clarify one another?</li>
<li>
<strong>Algorithms</strong> How well are algorithms encoded? Is the choice of computer
language appropriate for that algorithm, and/or envisioned use of package?
Are aspects of algorithmic scaling sufficiently documented and tested? Are
there any aspects of algorithmic implementation which could be improved?</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing</strong> Regardless of actual coverage of tests, are there any
fundamental software operations which are not sufficiently expressed in
tests? Is there a need for extended tests, or if extended tests exists, have
they been implemented in an appropriate way, and are they appropriately
documented?</li>
<li>
<strong>Visualisation</strong> (where appropriate) Do visualisations aid the primary
purposes of statistical interpretation of results? Are there any aspects of
visualisations which could risk statistical misinterpretation?</li>
<li>
<strong>Package Design</strong> Is the package well designed for its intended purpose? We
ask reviewers to consider the follow two aspects of package design:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>External Design:</strong> Do exported functions and the relationships between
them enable general usage of the package? Do exported functions best
serve inter-operability with other packages?</li>
<li>
<strong>Internal design:</strong> Are algorithms implemented appropriately in terms of
aspects such as efficiency, flexibility, generality, and accuracy? Could
ranges of admissible input structures, or form(s) of output structures,
be expanded to enhance inter-operability with other packages?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As algorithms form the core of statistical software, we ask reviewers to pay
particular attention to the assessment of algorithmic quality. Most
category-specific standards include a central “<em>Algorithmic Standards</em>”
component which can be used to provide starting points for more general
considerations of algorithmic quality. The <a href="standards.html#general-standards"><em>General Standard</em>
<strong>G1.1</strong></a> also requires all similar algorithms or
implementations to be documented within the software, so reviewers should also
have access to a list of comparable implementations.</p>
<p>Most of the above considerations are explicitly included in the reviewers’
template which follows.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Review Template<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pkgrev-template"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

checkbox items should be retained, and checked where appropriate, while other
lines, notably including questions in the <em>General Review</em> section, may be
