</h1>
<p>This book is the main document for rOpenSci’s project to expand peer review to
include explicitly statistic software. It is intended to aid both software
developers intending to submit statistical software for peer-review, and for
reviewers of statistical software. An additional aim of the project, and of
this documentation, is to serve as a blueprint for future adoption and
adaptation in other areas, including other computer languages.</p>
<p>The present book should be considered an extension
of rOpenSci’s guide to software <a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/">Development, Maintenance, and Peer
Review</a> (the “<em>Dev Guide</em>”). The guidelines and
expectations for software as presented in the <em>Dev Guide</em> also apply to
statistical software under the newly expanded system, with this document
describing additional guides and expectations for explicitly statistical
software. The <em>Dev Guide</em> ought thus be considered essential reading prior to
the current book.</p>
<p>This chapter summarises overall project aims, the scope of statistical software
we are currently able to consider, and provides a brief overview of the
structure and purpose of this book. It consists of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="overview.html#overview-motivation">Motivation: Why a separate system for statistical
software?</a></strong> in which we explain the necessity and advantages of
having statistical software developed according to concretes sets of explicit
standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="overview.html#overview-scope">Scope of Statistical Software Review</a></strong> in which we
summarise our working definition of “statistical software”, and the scope of
software currently able to be considered under the project. This scope is
based on explicit categories of statistical software, each of which is also
briefly described.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="overview.html#overview-prior-art">Prior Art</a></strong> in which we briefly describe a few
comparable systems for assessing and standardising software.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="overview.html#overview-use-of-book">Use of this Book</a></strong> in which we describe how this
book is intended to be read and used in practice.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="overview-motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Project Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-motivation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The official description of R declares it to be a <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">“software environment for
statistical computing and graphics”</a>, yet rOpenSci
previously deemed explicitly statistical packages out of scope, owing among
other factors to the perceived difficulty of devising an appropriate system for
assessment and review. R is nevertheless an explicitly <em>statistical</em> computing
environment, and so rOpenSci developed this project to expand our peer review
system to include statistical software.</p>
<p>In doing so, the project also offered an opportunity to reconsider and
potentially improve aspects of rOpenSci’s current system for peer review, which
had operated for five years by the time this project began, and had already
reviewed over &gt;200 packages, primarily in areas of data life cycle management.
The form of these packages continues to be strongly influenced by the <em>Dev
Guide</em>, which presents sets of
<a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/building.html">“guidelines”</a> which packages are
expected to “meet”. These guidelines are nevertheless necessarily general, and
were largely developed in ongoing response to successive developments in
technology to support software development, such as continuous integration
services. Although our <em>Dev Guide</em> effectively provides a set of “standards” to
which software is expected to adhere, the alignment of software to these
standards it itself not necessarily systematic, and in particular there is no
direct way to ascertain the standards to which a given piece of software
adheres, and those from which it may diverge.</p>
<p>The present project reflects a more systematic alignment of software with
standards, one which enables automated and ongoing identification of those
standards with which a given piece of software complies. The following sets of
standards for statistical software are thus far more extensive that our
previous “guidelines”, and provide ongoing assurance for users of the standard
of software accepted within our system, including systematic identification of
ways by which software may diverge from standards, and explanations of why.</p>
<p>Such assurance is important in many areas of scientific research, notably
including those subject to regulation such as pharmaceutical trials. Software
used in such trials must be <a href="https://pharmar.org/overview/">“validated”</a>,
generally through a process of identifying any <a href="https://github.com/pharmaR/risk_assessment">risks associated with using
that software</a>. In such contexts,
our system fosters confidence in the use of software assessed according to our
standards. For developers, the system provides a system of graded “badges” able
to be used to identify and publicise the assessment of their software as
meeting or exceeding the standards set by our system.</p>

<p>Close to one half of all code in all R packages to date has been written in the
R language, clearly justifying a primary focus upon that language. Collating
all possible ways of packaging and combining C and C++ code yields
17,752,262 lines or code or
33% of all code, indicating that
75% of all code has been
written in either R or C/C++. We anticipate the large majority of submissions
to be coded in one of these primary languages, and will cultivate a community
of reviewers with expertise in these languages. R packages may nevertheless
incorporate algorithms coded in a number of other languages (such as Rust), and
no package will be considered out-of-scope on the basis of computer language
alone. Developers using less common languages may nevertheless face longer
processing times to allow for finding reviewers with appropriate skills in
those languages.</p>

<div id="overview-categories" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Categories of Statistical Software<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-categories"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The scope of statistical software able to be submitted for peer review is
primarily defined by the following list of categories. Any software which fits
in to one or more of these categories may be deemed in-scope, and submitted for
review, while software which can not be described by any of these categories
will generally be deemed out of scope. While the categories themselves are
primarily defined by the corresponding standards given in detail in <a href="standards.html#standards">Chapter
6</a>, this chapter provides brief descriptions of the categories to
aid developers in initially estimating whether or not software may be in scope.</p>
<p>Empirical analyses described in <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">Appendix A.2</a> were
devised to identify sub-domains within statistical software, from which we have
to date developed standards for the following categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="#overview-bayesian">Bayesian and Monte Carlo Routines</a></li>
<li><a href="#overview-regression">Regression and Supervised Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-unsupervised">Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Unsupervised Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Summary Statistics</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-ts">Time Series Analyses</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-ml">Machine Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-spatial">Spatial Analyses</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these categories is represented by a set of standards, as briefly
described in the following sub-section. We anticipate that submissions will
commonly fit into, or be described by, multiple categories, and the standards
have also been devised to be as inter-compatible as possible. Moreover,
alignment with specific categories may not always be straightforward, and we
anticipate that some submissions will require negotiation between developers
and editors to identify appropriate categories prior to full submission.</p>
<p>We also intend to expand the system to include the additional four categories
of:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-wrapper">Wrapper Packages</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-networks">Network Analysis Software</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-distributions">Probability Distributions</a></li>
<li><a href="overview.html#overview-workflow">Workflow Support</a></li>
</ol>
<p>While software in these latter four categories is beyond the scope of current
standards, we invite any software developers interested in submitting software
within one or more of these categories to contact us directly to enquire about
the status of associated standards, and the possibility of submitting. Finally,
we anticipate our sets of standards to expand further over time, and openly
invite any form of discussion on the possibility of expanding our definition to
include additional categories.</p>
<p>The following sub-sections provide brief descriptions of each of our chosen
categories in terms of their general characteristics and inter-relationships
with other categories within our <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">empirical analyses</a>.
The standards of <a href="standards.html#standards">Chapter 6</a> necessarily consider each category
separately. There is nevertheless some degree of overlap between categorical
definitions which is it important to appreciate. The following brief
descriptions attempt to state some of the potentially problematic or
confounding areas of overlap and ambiguity between categorical definitions.
Titles of each sub-section link directly to the corresponding standards in
Chapter 6.</p>
<div id="bayesian-and-monte-carlo-routines" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> <a href="standards.html#standards-bayesian">Bayesian and Monte Carlo Routines</a><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#bayesian-and-monte-carlo-routines"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Bayesian and Monte Carlo software centres on quantitative estimation of
components of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem">Baye’s theorem</a>,
particularly on estimation or application of prior and/or posterior probability
distributions. The procedures implemented to estimate the properties of such
distributions are commonly based on random sampling procedures, hence referred
to as “<em>Monte Carlo</em>” routines in reference to the random yet quantifiable
nature of casino games.</p>
<p>Packages implementing or otherwise relying on Bayesian or Monte Carlo routines
are amongst the most common of our selected categories. Although roughly equal
in frequency to several other categories, this category represents the central
“hub” of all categories discerned in our <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">empirical
analyses</a>. This indicates that software in this category
is more likely than most others to also be described by additional categories.</p>
</div>
<div id="regression-and-supervised-learning" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.2</span> <a href="standards.html#standards-regression">Regression and Supervised Learning</a><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#regression-and-supervised-learning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Regression Software implements algorithms which aim to construct or analyse one
or more mappings between two defined data sets (for example, a set of
“independent” data, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and a set of “dependent” data, <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>). In contrast, the
analogous category of Unsupervised Learning Software aims to construct or
analyse one or more mappings between a defined set of input or independent
data, and a second set of “output” data which are not necessarily known or
given prior to the analysis.</p>
<p>Common purposes of Regression Software are to fit models to estimate
relationships or to make predictions between specified inputs and outputs.
Regression Software includes tools with inferential or predictive foci,
Bayesian, frequentist, or probability-free Machine Learning (ML) approaches,
parametric or or non-parametric approaches, discrete outputs (such as in
classification tasks) or continuous outputs, and models and algorithms specific
to applications or data such as time series or spatial data. In many cases
other standards specific to these subcategories may apply.</p>
<p>This category represents the most important intermediate node in the <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">emprical
network</a> between Bayesian/Monte Carlo and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms, as well as being strongly connected to several other
nodes. While many regression or interpolation algorithms are developed as part
of general frameworks within these contexts, there are nevertheless
sufficiently many examples of regression and interpolation algorithms unrelated
to these contexts to warrant the existence of this distinct category. That
said, algorithms within this category share very little in common, and each
implementation is generally devised for some explicit applied purpose which may
be difficult to relate to any other implementations in this category.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-unsupervised" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.3</span> Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Unsupervised Learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-unsupervised"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Software in this category is distinguished from Regression Software though the
latter aiming to construct or analyse one or more mappings between two defined
data sets (for example, a set of “independent” data, <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and a set of
“dependent” data, “Y”), whereas Unsupervised Learning Software aims to
construct or analyse one or more mappings between a defined set of input or
independent data, and a second set of “output” data which are not necessarily
known or given prior to the analysis. A key distinction in Unsupervised
Learning Software and Algorithms is between that for which output data
represent (generally numerical) transformations of the input data set, and that
for which output data are discrete labels applied to the input data. Examples
of the former type include dimensionality reduction and ordination software and
algorithms, and examples of the latter include clustering and discrete
partitioning software and algorithms. One of the primary problems presented by
algorithms in this category is that they are constrained to yield a result
independent on any measure of correctness of accuracy
<span class="citation">(Estivill-Castro <a href="appendices.html#ref-estivill-castro_why_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>. This can make assessment of the accuracy or
reliability of such algorithms difficult.</p>
<p>The node representing dimensionality reduction in our <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">empirical
network</a> is almost as central as the Bayesian/Monte Carlo
category, indicating the software in this category is also likely to be
described by additional categories.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-eda" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.4</span> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Summary Statistics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-eda"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Exploration is a part of all data analyses, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
is not something that is entered into and exited from at some point prior to
“real” analysis. Exploratory Analyses are also not strictly limited to <em>Data</em>,
but may extend to exploration of <em>Models</em> of those data. The category could
thus equally be termed, “<em>Exploratory Data and Model Analysis</em>”, yet we opt to
utilise the standard acronym of EDA in this document.</p>
<p>EDA is nevertheless somewhat different to many other categories included here,
primarily because,</p>
<ul>
<li>EDA software often has a strong focus upon visualization, which is a category
which we have otherwise explicitly excluded from the scope of the project at
the present stage.</li>
<li>The assessment of EDA software requires addressing more general questions
than software in most other categories, notably including the important
question of intended audience(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">empirical analyses</a> revealed a strong connection
between EDA and visualisation software, but EDA software nevertheless differed
in also being connected with calculation and presentation of summary
statistics, and with network relationships reflecting inter-relationships
between data components.</p>
</div>

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.5</span> Time Series Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-ts"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The category of Time Series software is arguably easier to define that the
preceding categories, and represents any software the primary input of which is
intended to be temporally structured data. Importantly, while “<em>temporally
structured</em>” may often imply temporally ordered, this need not necessarily be
the case. The primary definition of temporally structured data is that they
possess some kind of index which can be used to extract temporal relationships.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-ml" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.6</span> Machine Learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-ml"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) routines play a central role in modern statistical
analyses, and the ML node in the <a href="appendices.html#appendix-categories">empirical network
diagram</a> is roughly equally central, and equally
connected, to the Bayesian and Monte Carlo node. Machine Learning algorithms
represent perhaps some of the most difficult algorithms for which to develop
standards and methods of comparison. Both input and output data can be
categorically different or even incomparable, while even where these may be
comparable, the abiding aims of different ML algorithms can differ sufficiently
to make comparison of outputs to otherwise equivalent inputs largely
meaningless. The general ecosystem of ML software within R nevertheless offers
a number of tools which may be adapted for specific stages of many ML
workflows, and which may accordingly provide useful contexts for both of
aligning and reviewing software against standards, even if only as “benchmark”
comparisons. Divided into three main steps of input -&gt; processing -&gt; output,
useful tools include:</p>
<p><strong><em>Input Data</em></strong> The
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00584"><code>vtreat</code></a> package “prepares
messy real world data for predictive modeling in a reproducible and
statistically sound manner.” The routines in this package perform a series of
tests for general sanity of input data, and may prove generally useful as part
of a recommended ML workflow.</p>
<p><strong><em>Algorithms</em></strong> The aforementioned diversity of ML algorithms has fostered the
developed of several packages offering unified interfaces. As for input data,
standards do not suggest that any particular package use any of these, but they
should at least be considered as comparative benchmarks against which to assess
packages. Both the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01903"><code>mlr3</code></a>
and <a href="https://tidymodels.org"><code>tidymoels</code></a> collection of packages reflect
unified ML workflows with modular and extensible interfaces to a range of ML
routines.</p>
<p><strong><em>Output Data</em></strong> There are several extant packages for (post-)processing data
output from ML algorithms. Many, perhaps even most, of these primarily aim to
derive insightful visualisations of output, whether in interactive
(JavaScript-based) form, as with the
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01798"><code>modelStudio</code></a> or
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01444"><code>modelDown</code></a> packages, or
more static plots using internal graphical routines from R, as in the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00786"><code>iml</code>
(Interpretable Machine
Learning)</a> package. The
latter package offers a host of additional functionality useful in interpreting
the output of ML algorithms, and which may prove useful in general
standards-based contexts.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-spatial" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.7</span> Spatial Analyses<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-spatial"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>Spatial analyses have a long tradition in R, as summarised and reflected in the
CRAN Task Views on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html">Spatial</a>
and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html">Spatio-Temporal</a>
data and analyses. Those task views also make immediately apparent that the
majority of development in both of these domains has been in <em>representations</em>
of spatial data, rather than in statistical analyses <em>per se</em>.
Spatial statistical analyses have nevertheless been very strong in R, notably
through the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=spatstat"><code>spatstat</code></a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=gstat"><code>gstat</code></a> packages, first published
in 2002 and 2003, respectively.</p>
<p>Spatial analyses entail a number of aspects which, while not necessarily unique
in isolation, when considered in combination offer sufficiently unique
challenges for this to warrant its own category. Some of these unique aspects
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generally firm embeddedness in two dimensions</li>
<li>Frequent assumptions of continuous rather than discrete processes
(point-pattern processes notwithstanding)</li>
<li>A pervasive decrease in statistical similarity with increasing distance - the

<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.8</span> Probability Distributions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-distributions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>(<strong>Not yet in scope</strong>) The category of probability distributions is an outlier
in the preceding network diagram, connected only to ML and
regression/interpolation algorithms. It is nevertheless included here as
a distinct category because we anticipate software which explicitly represents
or relies on probability distributions to be subject to distinct standards and
assessment procedures, particularly through enabling routines to be tested for
robustness against a variety of perturbations to assumed distributional forms.</p>
<p>Packages which fall within this category include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01863"><code>univariateML</code></a> which
is, “an R package for maximum likelihood estimation of univariate
densities,” which support more than 20 different forms of probability
density.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01566"><code>kdensity</code></a> which is,
“An R package for kernel density estimation with parametric starts and
asymmetric kernels.” This package implements an effectively non-parametric
approach to estimating probability densities.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01023"><code>overlapping</code></a>, which
is, “a R package for estimating overlapping in empirical distributions.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The obverse process from estimating or fitting probability distributions is
arguably drawing samples from defined distributions, of which the
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00629"><code>humanleague</code></a> package is
an example. This package has a particular application in synthesis of discrete
populations, yet the implementation is quite generic and powerful.</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-wrapper" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.9</span> Wrapper Packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-wrapper"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>(<strong>Not yet in scope</strong>) “Wrapper” packages provide an interface to
previously-written software, often in a different computer language to the
original implementation. While this category is reasonably unambiguous, there
may be instances in which a “wrapper” additionally offers extension beyond
original implementations, or in which only a portion of a package’s
functionality may be “wrapped.” Rather than internally bundling or wrapping
software, a package may also serve as a wrapper thorough providing access to
some external interface, such as a web server. Examples of potential wrapper
packages include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The
<a href="https://github.com/greta-dev/greta"><code>greta</code> package</a>
(with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01601">JOSS article</a>) “for
writing statistical models and fitting them by MCMC and optimisation”
provides a wrapper around google’s
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org"><code>TensorFlow</code> library</a>. It is also clearly a workflow package, aiming to
provide a single, unified workflow for generic machine learning processes
and analyses.</li>
<li>The
<a href="https://github.com/keblu/nse"><code>nse</code> package</a> (with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00172">JOSS paper</a>) which
offers “multiple ways to calculate numerical standard errors (NSE) of
univariate (or multivariate in some cases) time series,” through providing
a unified interface to several other R packages to provide more than 30 NSE
estimators. This is an example of a wrapper package which does not wrap
either internal code or external interfaces, rather it effectively “wraps”
the algorithms of a collection of R packages.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>Key Considerations</em></strong>: For many wrapper packages it may not be feasible
for reviewers (or authors) to evaluate the quality or correctness of the wrapped
software, so review could be limited to the interface or added value provided,
or the statistical routines within.</p>
<p>Wrapper packages include the extent of functionality represented by wrapped
code, and the computer language being wrapped.
- <em>Internal or External:</em> Does the software <em>internally</em> wrap of bundle
previously developed routines, or does it provide a wrapper around some
external service? If the latter, what kind of service (web-based, or some
other form of remote access)?
- <em>Language:</em> For internally-bundled routines, in which computer language
e the routines written? And how are they bundled? (For R packages: In
<code>./src</code>? In <code>./inst</code>? Elsewhere?)
- <em>Testing:</em> Does the software test the correctness of the wrapped component?
Does it rely on tests of the wrapped component elsewhere?
- <em>Unique Advances:</em> What unique advances does the software offer beyond
those offered by the (internally or externally) wrapped software?</p>
</div>
<div id="overview-networks" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.10</span> Networks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-networks"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>(<strong>Not yet in scope</strong>) Network software is a particular area of application of
what might often be considered more generic algorithms, as in the example
described above of the
<a href="https://github.com/jakobbossek/grapherator"><code>grapherator</code></a> package, for which
this category is appropriate only because the input data are assumed to
represent a particular form of graphical relationship, while most of the
algorithms implemented in the package are not necessarily specific to graphs.
That package might nevertheless be useful in developing standards because it,
“implements a modular approach to benchmark graph generation focusing on
undirected, weighted graphs”. This package, and indeed several others developed
by its author <a href="http://www.jakobbossek.de/blog/">Jakob Bossek</a>, may be useful in
developing benchmarks for comparison of graph or network models and algorithms.</p>
<p>Cases of software which might be assessed using such generic graph generators
and benchmarks include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00374"><code>mcMST</code></a>, which is “a
toolbox for the multi-criteria minimum spanning tree problem.”</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00036"><code>gwdegree</code></a>, which is
a package for, “improving interpretation of geometrically-weighted degree
estimates in exponential random graph models.” This package essentially
generates one key graph statistic from a particular class of input graphs,
yet is clearly amenable to benchmarking, as well as measures of stability in
response to variable input structures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Network software which is likely more difficult to assess or compare in any
general way includes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01480"><code>tcherry</code></a> is a package
for “Learning the structure of tcherry trees,” which themselves are
particular ways of representing relationships between categorical data. The
package uses maximum likelihood techniques to find the best tcherry tree to
represent a given input data set. Although very clearly a form of network
software, this package might be considered better described by other
categories, and accordingly not directly assessed or assessable under any
standards derived for this category.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.bnlearn.com/"><code>BNLearn</code></a> is a package “for learning the
graphical structure of Bayesian networks.” It is indubitably a network
package, yet the domain of application likely renders it incomparable to
other network software, and difficult to assess in any standardised way.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="overview-workflow" class="section level4">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.11</span> Workflow Support<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-workflow"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>(<strong>Not yet in scope</strong>) “Workflow” software may not implement particular methods
or algorithms, but rather support tasks around the statistical process. In
many cases, these may be generic tasks that apply across methods. These
include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Classes (whether explicit or not) for representing or processing input and
output data;</li>
<li>Generic interfaces to multiple statistical methods or algorithms;</li>
<li>Homogeneous reporting of the results of a variety of methods or algorithms;
and</li>
<li>Methods to synthesise, visualise, or otherwise collectively report on
analytic results.</li>
</ol>
<p>Methods and Algorithms software may only provide a specific interface to
a specific method or algorithm, although it may also be more general and offer
several of the above “workflow” aspects, and so ambiguity may often arise
between these two categories. We note in particular that the “workflow” node in
the
<a href="https://ropenscilabs.github.io/statistical-software/abstracts/network-terms">interactive network diagram</a>
mentioned above is very strongly connected to the “machine learning” node,
generally reflecting software which attempts to unify varied interfaces to
varied platforms for machine learning.</p>
<p>Among the numerous examples of software in this category are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The
<a href="https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3"><code>mlr3</code> package</a> (with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01903">JOSS paper</a>), which provides, “A modern object-oriented machine learning
framework in R.”</li>
<li>The
<a href="https://github.com/USCbiostats/fmcmc"><code>fmcmc</code> package</a>
(with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01427">JOSS paper</a>), which provides a unified framework and workflow for
Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analyses.</li>
<li>The
<a href="https://github.com/easystats/bayestestR"><code>bayestestR</code> package</a> (with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01541">JOSS paper</a>)
for "describing effects and their uncertainty, existence and significance
within the Bayesian framework. While this packages includes its own
algorithmic implementations, it is primarily intended to aid general
Bayesian workflows through a unified interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Workflows are also commonly required and developed for specific areas of
application, as exemplified by the
<a href="https://github.com/nfrerebeau/tabula"><code>tabular</code> package</a> (with accompanying
<a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01821">JOSS article</a> for “Analysis, Seriation, and visualisation of Archaeological
Count Data”.</p>
<p><strong><em>Key Considerations:</em></strong> Workflow packages are popular and add considerable value
and efficiency for users. One challenge in evaluating such packages is the
importance of API design and potential subjectivity of this. For instance,
<code>mlr3</code> as well as <code>tidymodels</code> have similar uses of providing a common interface
to multiple predictive models and tools for automating processes across these
models. Similar, multiple packages have different approaches for handling MCMC
data. Each package makes different choices in design and has different priorities,
which may or may not agree with reviewers’ opinions or applications. Despite such
differences, it may be possible to evaluate such packages for <em>internal</em> cohesion,
and adherence to a sufficiently clearly stated design goal. Reviewers may be able
to evaluate whether the package provides a <em>more</em> unified workflow or interface
than other packages - this would require a standard of relative improvement over
the field rather than baseline standards.</p>
<p>These packages also often contain numerical routines (cross-validation,
performance scoring, model comparison), that can be evaluated for correctness
or accuracy.</p>

<p>rOpenSci’s current software peer-review process, detailed in our <a href="https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html">developer
guide</a>, is based on a
blend of practices from peer review of academic practices and code review in
open-source projects. Review takes place via an issue thread in our
<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/software-review">“software-review” repository on
GitHub</a>. The review process is
entirely open, with each issue thread used to manage the entire process,
coordinated by rOpenSci’s editors. After initial screening for scope and minimal
qualification by editors, two reviewers provide comments and feedback on software
packages. After one or more rounds of revisions, packages reach a point of
approval, at which point they are “accepted” by rOpenSci, symbolized both
through a badge system, and (generally) through transferring the software from
the authors’ private domain to the

</h3>
<p>The development of software for the open-source <a href="https://debian.org">Debian Operating
System</a> is guided by Debian Developers and Debian
Maintainers. Expressed roughly, maintainers are individuals responsible for the
maintenance of particular pieces of software, while developers engage with
activities supporting the development of the operating system as a whole. The
submission and review process for Debian is almost entirely automated, based on
tools such as their own software checker,
<a href="https://lintian.debian.org"><code>lintian</code></a>. Debian differs fundamentally from the
system proposed here in being centred around the trust and verification of
people rather than software. Submission of software to Debian is largely
automatic, and bug-free software may often progress automatically through
various stages towards acceptance. Software may, however, only be submitted by
official Debian Maintainers or Developers. People can only become developers or
maintainers through being sponsored by existing members, and are then subject
to review of the potential contribution they may be able to make to the broader
Debian community. (Details can be seen in <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.becoming-package-maintainer.html">this chapter of the Debian
handbook</a>.)</p>
<p>While the general process for software submission and acceptance in Debian may
not be of direct relevance, their versioning policy provides a useful basis for
our own versioning system. The ongoing development of both the Debian system
and all associated packages proceeds in accordance with a versioned <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/index.html">policy
manual</a>. All new packages
must comply to the current standards at the time of submission, and are
labelled with the latest version of the standards to which they comply, <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-source.html#standards-conformance">noting
that</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a package to have an old Standards-Version value is not itself a bug …
It just means that no-one has yet reviewed the package with changes to
the standards in mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each new version of the standards is accompanied by a simple
<a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/upgrading-checklist.html">checklist</a>
of differences, explicitly indicating differences with and divergences from
previous versions. As long as software continues to pass all tests, upgrading
to current standards remains optional. Failing tests in response to any
upgrading of standards serve as a trigger for review of software. The nominated
standards version may only be updated once review has confirmed compliance with
current standards. The present project adapts some of these aspects of the
Debian system, as described below.</p>

</h2>
<p>This book is primarily intended to be used by the two primary audiences of
<em>software developers</em> and <em>reviewers</em>. As mentioned above, it is also intended
to serve as a “blueprint” to be adopted and adapted to other areas, including
other computer languages, and other domains of application. The book has two
primary entry points for these two primary audiences, with the following
chapter providing extensive guidelines for package development, submission, and
maintenance, and a subsequent chapter providing guidelines for reviewers of
software submissions. Both audiences will need to refer to the actual
<a href="standards.html#standards">standards</a>, both general and category-specific. The book also
includes important guidelines for our editors, in particular to instruct them
on the capabilities of our automated <code>ropensci-review-bot</code>, and associated
automatic package checking routines.</p>
<p>Importantly, the entire project strives to cultivate diverse, inclusive, and
geographically expansive communities, in terms both of software itself, and
associated communities of developers, reviewers, and users. Note that while
these aspects of community are not explicitly addressed throughout any of the
remainder of this document, it is important that future revisions return to
this point, and ensure that each of the following sections are appropriately
modified to ensure effective consideration and incorporation of the
representativeness and inclusiveness of communities cultivating and surrounding
our software.</p>
